## Exercise 1-7

Rewrite these C/C++ excerpts more clearly:

```c
if (istty(stdin)) ;
else if (istty(stdout)) ;
     else if (istty(stderr)) ;
          else return(0);
```

```c
if (retval != SUCCESS)
{
    return (retval);
}
/* All went well! */
return SUCCESS;
```

```c
for (k = 0; k++ < 5; x += dx)
    scanf("%lf", &dx)
```

## Solution

**First excerpt**

First of all, the correct function to test for TTY types is `isatty(3)` (declared in `unistd.h`), not `istty()`.

The code is ugly because of the various empty `if` bodies. The parentheses in `return(0);` are unnecessary and the lack of spaces makes it seem like `return` is a function rather than a keyword.

This is much easier to read and understand, does away with the unnecessary and useless parentheses, and uses the right function:

```c
if (!isatty(stdin) && !isatty(stdout) && !isatty(stderr))
    return 0;
```

**Second excerpt**

The comment is useless, and the if tests are unnecessary. This is all we need:

```c
return retval;
```

**Third excerpt**

This loop is not idiomatic: `k` is incremented as a side-effect of the test condition, and the increment condition contains code that suits the loop body better. This is much easier to read:

```c
for (k = 0; k < 5; k++) {
    scanf("%lf", &dx);
    x += dx;
}
k++;
```

Note that because the loop test always runs once more than the loop body, the final value of `k` in the original code is 6. Thus, to keep the new (improved) version equivalent, we need to increment `k` after the loop.

If `k` is not used after the loop, this is irrelevant.
