## Exercise 1-6

List all the different outputs this could produce with various orders of evaluation:

```c
n = 1;
printf("%d %d\n", n++, n++);
```

Try it on as many compilers as you can, to see what happens in practice.

## Solution

This program has undefined behavior because it modifies the same object more than once between two sequence points: `n` is modified twice with the post-increment operator between the sequence point that terminates the previous statement and the sequence point immediately before entering `printf(3)`.

In practice though, the problem is again order of evaluation.

The possibilities are:

* Arguments are evaluated left-to-right, so we get `1 2`.
* Arguments are evaluated right-to-left, so we get `2 1`.
* `n` is kept in a register and incremented in memory, so we get `1 1` (and the final value for `n` is 2)

The third possibility is unlikely, but it can happen; we're violating the language rules and inovking undefined behavior, so it is very much possible that something like that happens.

The following code was used in this exercise:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
	int n = 1;
	printf("%d %d\n", n++, n++);
	return 0;
}
```

In Linux, when compiled with gcc, this prints `2 1`; when compiled with clang it prints `1 2`. Optimization levels didn't make a difference. The same happened in OS X Yosemite.
