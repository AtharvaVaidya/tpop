## Exercise 1-2

Improve this function:

```c
int smaller(char *s, char *t) {
    if (strcmp(s, t) < 1)
        return 1;
    else
        return 0;
}
```

## Solution

`is_smaller()` is probably a better name than `smaller()`; although there isn't much of a difference, the former conveys better the idea that the function returns a boolean value, and adheres to the proposed convention for boolean functions proposed earlier in the chapter.

`s` and `t` should have more descriptive names - in the world of C++, a common choice is `lhs` and `rhs`, for *left-hand side* and *right-hand side*. It also makes the return value much clearer: if the first argument is the left-hand side of the comparison, then the function returns true if the first argument is less than the second.

Finally, the function body can be simplified without compromising readability and clarity by a single call to `strcmp(3)`:

```c
int is_smaller(char *lhs, char *rhs) {
    return strcmp(lhs, rhs) < 0;
}
```

Note that we choose `< 0` here rather than `< 1`. We believe `< 1` is wrong because `strcmp(3)` returns `0` if the strings are equal, but `is_smaller()` shouldn't return true if that happens, so the correct code needs `< 0`.
