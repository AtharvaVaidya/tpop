## Exercise 1-11

Comment on these comments.

```cpp
void dict::insert(string& w)
// returns 1 if w in dictionary, otherwise returns 0
```

```c
if (n > MAX || n % 2 > 0) // test for even number
```

```c
// Write a message
// Add to line counter for each line written

void write_message()
{
    // increment line counter
    line_number = line_number + 1;
    fprintf(fout, "%d %s\n%d %s\n%d %s\n",
        line_number, HEADER,
        line_number + 1, BODY,
        line_number + 2, TRAILER);
    // increment line counter
    line_number = line_number + 2;
}
```

## Solution

**First excerpt**

The function is `void`. How is it supposed to return anything? This is probably an outdated comment.

**Second excerpt**

The comment is inconsistent with the code. The code tests if `n > MAX` or if `n` is odd.

**Third excerpt**

*Write a message* is not really a useful comment for a function named `write_message()`. The comments saying *increment line counter* are utterly unnecessary, the code speaks by itself. Also, incrementing usually means adding 1, yet `line_number` is incremented by 2 in one of the cases. In fact, *Add to line counter for each line written* is also pretty obvious; after all, if the variable is named `line_number`, we should increment it for each line written, no?

The function is relatively well written and understandable, there's no need for comments whatsoever.
