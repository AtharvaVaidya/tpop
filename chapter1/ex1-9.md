## Exercise 1-9

Identify the problems with this macro definition:

```c
#define ISDIGIT(c) ((c >= '0') && (c <= '9')) ? 1 : 0
```

## Solution

* There should be parentheses around `c` and around the entire macro body, to avoid hard-to-track bugs as showed earlier in the book
* `c` is evaluated twice
* There's no need to use the `? :` operator

Here's a much better alternative:

```c
#define ISDIGIT(c) ((c) >= '0' && (c) <= '9')
```

Of course, `c` is still evaluated twice. The fact that this macro must evaluate to an expression makes it harder to avoid this, because we can't have declarations in an expression.

GCC has an extension that allows statements and declarations to occur in expressions by wrapping the macro body in `({ ... })`. The last statement in the block is the value of the expression, so we could do this to avoid evaluating `c` twice:

```c
#define ISDIGIT(c) ({int c_tmp = (c); c_tmp >= '0' && c_tmp <= '9';})
```

This comes at the cost of portability, and it's not perfect. If we happen to call it with a variable named `c_tmp`, all hell breaks lose, because `c_tmp` will be initialized to itself with a meaningless value.

At the end of the day, in any case, inline functions are almost certainly a superior choice.
