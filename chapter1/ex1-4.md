## Exercise 1-5

Improve each of these fragments:

```c
if ( !(c == 'y' || c == 'Y') )
   return;
```

```c
length = (length < BUFSIZE) ? length : BUFSIZE;
```

```c
flag = flag ? 0 : 1;
```

```c
quote = (*line == '"') ? 1 : 0;
```

```c
if (val & 1)
    bit = 1;
else
    bit = 0;
```

## Solution

**First fragment**

Negated conditions inside `if` tests are hard to read. It is often a good idea to avoid them, as suggested earlier in the book. This is much more readable:

```c
if (c != 'y' && c != 'Y')
    return;
```

**Second fragment**

This is easier to read if we write it like this:

```c
if (length > BUFSIZE)
   length = BUFSIZE;
```

Or even simpler:

```c
length = min(length, BUFSIZE);
```

**Third fragment**

No need to use the `? :` operator. This will do:

```c
flag = !flag;
```

It also makes it easier to understand that we just want to negate the meaning of `flag`.

**Fourth fragment**

This is really the same as:

```c
quote = (*line == '"');
```

Or:

```c
if (*line == '"')
    quote = 1;
else
    quote = 0;
```

Both forms are equivalent and superior to the `? :` alternative, because the latter forces us to mentally evaluate the condition to see the possible outcomes.

**Fifth fragment**

Those 4 lines of code can be replaced by a one-liner without compromising readability and simplicity (and it's probably even easier to understand the intent here):

```c
bit = val & 1;
```
