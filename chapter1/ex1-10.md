## Exercise 1-10

How would you rewrite these definitions to minimize potential errors?

```c
#define FT2METER 0.30408
#define METER2FT 3.28084
#define MI2FT 5280.0
#define MI2KM 1.609344
#define SQMI2SQKM 2.589988
```

## Solution

enums can't be used here, so we can resort to good old `static const` globals:

```c
static const double FT2METER = 0.30408;
static const double METER2FT = 3.28084;
static const double MI2FT = 5280.0;
static const double MI2KM = 1.609344;
static const double SQMI2SQKM = 2.589988;
```

If these constants must be known to other translation units in the program, we can't use `static`.
