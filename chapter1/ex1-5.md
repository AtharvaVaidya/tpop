## Exercise 1-5

What is wrong with this excerpt?

```c
int read(int *ip) {
    scanf("%d", ip);
    return *ip;
}

...

insert(&graph[vert], read(&val), read(&ch));
```

## Solution

The problem is that order of evaluation of a function's arguments is undefined. There is only a sequence point immediately before the function is entered, and the use of comma to separate the function parameters is not a use of the comma operator (which would introduce a sequence point between each pair of arguments), and as such order of evaluation is undefined. The only guarantee is that all side effects have taken place before `insert()` is entered.

This is problematic because `read()` has the side effect of doing I/O to read from the standard input. The code asks for trouble because `read(&val)` may occur before or after `read(&ch)`, so the value that was supposed to be `val` may be read into `ch`, or vice versa.
