## Exercise 1-8

Identify the errors in this Java fragment and repair it by rewriting with an idiomatic loop:

```Java
int count = 0;
while (count < total) {
    count++;
    if (this.getName(count) == nameTable.userName()) {
        return (true);
    }
}
```

## Solution

The `getName()` function seems to be the sort of function that receives an offset index in an array (or equivalent data structure) to retrieve the corresponding entry; if that's the case, then there is an off-by-one error because `count` is incremented before, thus accessing the array one position past the end. `count` doesn't seem to be a good name choice, it is in fact used as an array index. This function is simply traversing an array-like data structure to check if a given name exists. Single letter variable names such as `i` or `j` are enough for this.

Using an idiomatic loop not only fixes the off-by-one error, but also scopes the control variable to the loop construct, and makes the code easier to read.

```Java
for (int i = 0; i < total; i++) {
    if (this.getName(i) == nameTable.userName()) {
        return true;
    }
}
```
